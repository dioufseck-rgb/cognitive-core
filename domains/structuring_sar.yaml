description: BSA/AML structuring alerts — cash deposits below CTR threshold.

classify_alert:
  categories: |
    - structuring: Pattern of transactions designed to avoid CTR thresholds ($10,000).
    - unusual_wire_activity: Wire transfers to high-risk jurisdictions.
    - rapid_movement: Funds deposited and quickly moved out (layering).
    - combined_typology: Multiple suspicious typologies present.
  criteria: |
    Analyze: Are cash deposits below $10,000? Wire transfers to high-risk
    jurisdictions? Unusual velocity? Multiple branches used?

investigate_activity:
  scope: |
    1. STRUCTURING: Are deposits deliberately below $10K? Statistical likelihood?
    2. BUSINESS LEGITIMACY: Does business type explain cash volume?
    3. WIRE ANALYSIS: Destination jurisdiction risk level?
    4. VELOCITY: Compare to prior 6-month average.
    5. BRANCH PATTERN: Alternating branches = smurfing indicator?
    6. PRIOR HISTORY: Prior alerts or SARs?

classify_filing_decision:
  categories: |
    - file_sar: Activity meets SAR filing criteria under 31 CFR 1020.320.
    - no_sar_document: Does not meet threshold. Document review rationale.
    - request_additional_info: Cannot determine without more information.
  criteria: |
    31 CFR 1020.320: Transactions of $5,000+ where institution knows, suspects,
    or has reason to suspect: (a) illegal funds, (b) evasion of reporting,
    (c) no lawful purpose, (d) facilitating criminal activity.

    FinCEN SAR narrative — WHO, WHAT, WHEN, WHERE, WHY, HOW.
  constraints: |
    - Factual and objective, no speculation about guilt
    - Precise dollar amounts and dates
    - Do not use "suspicious" to describe the subject, only the activity

    - Include total amounts, prior alerts/SARs
    - 500-2000 words, third person, no tipping-off language

challenge_narrative:
  perspective: FinCEN examiner and defense attorney
  threat_model: |
    1. Completeness: All five W's and How addressed?
    2. Accuracy: Amounts, dates, details consistent?
    3. Objectivity: No subjective conclusions about intent?
    4. Regulatory compliance: Meets FinCEN requirements?
    5. Tipping off: Any language alerting the subject?
    6. Legal defensibility: Misleading or biased?
    7. Pattern documentation: Structuring clearly documented?
    8. Jurisdiction: High-risk jurisdictions flagged?
