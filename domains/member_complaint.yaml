  Domain expertise for handling member service complaints —
  inconsistent information, fees, service failures, process breakdowns.

classify_complaint_type:
  categories: |
    - service_inconsistency: Member received conflicting information from
      different agents or channels. Trust and competence concern.
    - fee_dispute: Member disputes a fee or charge. May or may not be valid.
    - process_failure: A process did not work as designed (hold not released,
      payment not processed, card not activated, etc.)
    - policy_disagreement: Member understands the policy but disagrees with it.
    - staff_conduct: Complaint about how they were treated by staff.
    - product_issue: Product not working as expected (mobile app, card, etc.)
    - multi_issue: Complaint spans multiple categories.
  criteria: |
    Classify the ROOT problem, not the surface frustration.
    If a member is upset about fees but the fees resulted from a process
    failure, classify as process_failure (the fees are a symptom).
    If inconsistent information AND fees AND process failure, use multi_issue.

classify_severity:
  categories: |
    - critical_escalation: Regulatory risk (UDAAP, fair lending), legal
      threat, social media escalation, or senior member with high attrition
      risk mentioning account closure.
    - high_priority: Financial harm occurred (fees, bounced payments),
      multiple contact attempts, or member tenure > 5 years with
      relationship value > $25K.
    - standard: Normal complaint requiring resolution within SLA.
    - low_priority: Minor inconvenience, first occurrence, easily resolved.
  criteria: |
    ESCALATION TRIGGERS (any one = critical):
    - Member mentions lawsuit, attorney, CFPB, regulator, or media
    - 3+ contacts on same issue without resolution
    - Financial harm > $100 AND attrition risk > 0.5 AND tenure > 3 years
    - Fair lending indicators

    HIGH PRIORITY TRIGGERS:
    - Financial harm occurred (fees, bounced payments, credit impact)
    - Member mentions closing accounts
    - Multiple failed resolution attempts
    - Long-tenured member with significant relationship

investigate_complaint:
  effort_level: deep
  scope: |
    1. ROOT CAUSE: What actually happened? Trace the timeline from the
       member's perspective. What went wrong at each touchpoint?
    2. FINANCIAL IMPACT: Quantify all harm — fees, bounced payments,
       late charges, credit impact. Be specific with dollar amounts.
    3. SERVICE FAILURE: Were the agents wrong? Was the system wrong?
       Was there a training gap or a system issue?
    4. REMEDIATION: What should we do to make this right?
       - Fee reversal: warranted? Amount?
       - Apology: what level? (agent, supervisor, letter)
       - Process fix: what needs to change to prevent recurrence?
       - Goodwill gesture: warranted given relationship value and harm?
    5. RETENTION RISK: Given the member's tenure, relationship value,
       and stated frustration level, what's the retention calculus?
       A 6-year member with $45K in products and direct deposit is
       worth significantly more than $50 in fees.

generate_response:
  format: member_response_letter
  requirements: |
    Write a response to the member that:
    1. Acknowledges their frustration specifically (not generically)
    2. Takes responsibility — do not deflect or blame the member
    3. Explains what happened (briefly, in plain language)
    4. States exactly what remediation is being provided
    5. Explains what we're doing to prevent this from happening again
    6. Provides a direct contact for follow-up (name and phone number)
    7. Reaffirms their value as a member

    TONE: Sincere apology, not corporate script. Use their name. Be
    specific about what went wrong. Don't over-apologize — be direct
    and action-oriented.
  constraints: |
    - Never blame the member
    - Never use "per our policy" or "as you know"
    - Include specific dollar amounts for any fee reversals
    - Include specific timeline for any process fixes
    - 8th grade reading level
    - Under 400 words
    - UDAAP: no misleading statements about what happened
    - If fees are reversed, state it definitively ("we have reversed")
      not conditionally ("we may consider")

challenge_response:
  perspective: |
    Review from three perspectives:
    1. THE MEMBER (Michael Torres): Do I feel heard? Do I believe they
       understand what went wrong? Am I satisfied with the remediation?
       Will I keep my accounts open?
    2. COMPLIANCE EXAMINER: Any UDAAP concerns? Is the explanation accurate?
       Does the fee reversal set problematic precedent, or is it appropriate?
    3. RETENTION ANALYST: Given a 6-year member with $45K relationship value,
       direct deposit, and 0.6 attrition risk — is this response sufficient
       to retain them?
  threat_model: |
    CRITICAL:
    - Blaming the member for the issue
    - Factual inaccuracies about what happened
    - Missing the financial remediation entirely
    - UDAAP violation (misleading about fees or process)

    HIGH:
    - Generic apology that doesn't address specific failures
    - Missing fee reversal when fees resulted from our error
    - No direct contact for follow-up
    - Defensive or dismissive tone

    MEDIUM:
    - Response too long or corporate-sounding
    - Missing acknowledgment of multiple failed contacts
    - No mention of process improvement
    - Fee reversal without explaining why
