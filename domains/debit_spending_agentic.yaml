description: >
  Agentic domain configuration for debit card spending analysis.
  The orchestrator sequences primitives dynamically based on the
  member's question and what it discovers along the way.

goal: |
  Answer the member's financial question with grounded, accurate,
  personalized advice based on their transaction history and stated
  financial goals.

  The member's question is in the case data under "member_question".
  Their transaction history, monthly summaries, financial goals, and
  profile are in the other data sources.

  Your final deliverable is a conversational chat message that:
  1. Directly answers what they asked
  2. Uses specific numbers from their data
  3. Connects to their stated goals
  4. Provides actionable advice
  5. Has been verified for accuracy by a challenge step

orchestrator_strategy: |
  SEQUENCING GUIDANCE:
  - Always retrieve data first. You cannot analyze what you haven't fetched.
  - Classify the question to understand what the member is really asking.
    This focuses the investigation.
  - Investigate with the specific question type in mind. Extract actual
    numbers before drawing conclusions.
  - For simple, single-factor questions (e.g., "how much do I spend on
    coffee?"), go straight from investigate to generate. No think needed.
  - For multi-factor questions — goal progress, reduction advice, pattern
    analysis with implications, or follow-up questions that build on prior
    conversation — use THINK to connect findings to goals, assess tradeoffs,
    or decide what advice to prioritize before generating.
  - Generate a conversational response grounded in the investigation findings
    (and think conclusions, if a think step was used).
  - Challenge the response for accuracy, regulatory safety, and helpfulness.
  - If the challenge fails, regenerate with the vulnerabilities as feedback.
    Do not re-challenge the same content.

  WHEN TO USE THINK:
  - Member asks about goal progress and investigation shows conflicting signals
    (spending up but savings steady, or vice versa)
  - Member asks for reduction advice and there are multiple categories to weigh
  - Investigation produced findings that need interpretation, not just reporting
  - Follow-up question that needs to reconcile new findings with prior conversation
  
  WHEN TO SKIP THINK:
  - Simple factual inquiry: "how much did I spend on X?"
  - Single data point answer: "what's my biggest category?"
  - The investigation finding directly answers the question with no ambiguity

  You are free to skip classify if the question is obvious, or to
  investigate multiple times if the first pass was insufficient. The
  constraints enforce the guardrails; within them, use your judgment.

      specification: |
        Required data sources:
          - member_profile: Name, age, tenure, income band, balances

          - financial_goals: Stated savings and spending goals
          - monthly_summaries: Pre-aggregated monthly spending by category
          - transactions: Raw transaction history for detailed analysis
        Conditional (include if available):
          - prior_conversation: Previous conversation turns
      strategy: deterministic

  classify_inquiry:
    primitive: classify
    temperature: 0.05
    params:
      categories: |
        - spending_category_inquiry: Member asks about spending in a specific category
        - pattern_analysis: Member asks about spending patterns or trends
        - goal_progress: Member asks about progress toward a financial goal
        - reduction_advice: Member asks for advice on how to cut spending
        - comparison: Member compares spending across time periods or categories
        - multi_topic: Member asks about multiple things at once
      criteria: |
        Consider the member's exact words and intent.
        If the question covers multiple topics, classify as multi_topic.
        If the member expresses frustration about spending, lean toward
        reduction_advice even if they phrase it as a question.

  investigate_spending:

    params:
      question: |
        The member asked: "${_last_retrieve.data.member_question}"
        Classification: ${_last_classify.category}
        Analyze their transaction data to answer this question thoroughly.
      scope: |
        Analyze the member's debit card transaction data.
        Use specific numbers — extract monthly totals before characterizing trends.
        For spending inquiries: monthly totals, trends (with start/end values), top merchants.
        For goal progress: current vs target, projected completion, shortfall if any.
        For patterns: day-of-month distribution, seasonal variation, peaks with causes.

        Follow-up investigation based on prior findings.
        Prior finding: ${_last_investigate.finding}
        Dig deeper into the specific area that needs more analysis.
      scope: |
        Focus on the specific gap identified in the prior investigation.
        Extract specific values. Show your work.

    params:
      instruction: |
        The member asked: "${_last_retrieve.data.member_question}"

        Investigation found: ${_last_investigate.finding}

        Their financial goals: ${_last_retrieve.data.financial_goals}

        Think through what this means for the member personally:
        1. How do the spending patterns connect to their goals? Are they
           helping, hurting, or neutral?
        2. If there are competing priorities (e.g., spending more on
           dining but also saving for emergency fund), what's the
           tradeoff and what should they prioritize?
        3. What's the most actionable advice — not generic "spend less"
           but specific to what the data shows?
        4. Is there anything encouraging to highlight? People respond
           better to "you're doing well here, adjust there" than to
           a list of problems.
      focus: |
        Keep the member's actual question central. Don't wander into
        areas they didn't ask about. If the investigation fully answers
        the question, just distill the key insight — don't overthink it.

        Write a response as a personal financial advisor in a mobile chat.
        TONE: Warm, direct, encouraging. Use their first name. Be specific.

        4. Keep under 300 words
        5. No bullet points — write naturally

      perspective: |
        Review from three angles:
        1. ACCURACY: Do numbers match investigation findings?
        2. REGULATORY SAFETY: Could anything be construed as investment advice?
        3. MEMBER EXPERIENCE: Is this helpful, specific, and appropriately toned?
      threat_model: |
        CRITICAL: Fabricated numbers, reversed trends, investment recommendations
        HIGH: Wrong numbers, misleading framing
        MEDIUM: Generic advice, missed the question, too verbose
        LOW: Minor tone issues
