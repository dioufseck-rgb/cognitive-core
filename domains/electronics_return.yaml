  Domain configuration for electronics product returns.
  Covers laptops, tablets, monitors, peripherals, and accessories.
  Higher fraud scrutiny due to high item values and resale potential.

classify_return_type:
  categories: |
    - defective_product: The item has a hardware defect, software issue, or
      does not function as described. Customer reports malfunction.
    - buyers_remorse: Customer changed their mind, found a better price,
      or no longer wants the item. No defect claimed.
    - not_as_described: Item specifications, appearance, or features differ
      from what was advertised or expected.
    - damaged_on_arrival: Item arrived with physical damage from shipping.
      Packaging may also be damaged.
    - wrong_item_received: A different product was shipped than what was ordered.
  criteria: |
    Analyze the return request description. Consider:
    - Does the customer describe a specific defect or malfunction?
    - Is the return within the standard return window (30 days for electronics)?
    - Does the customer mention the item not matching the listing?
    - Are there signs of shipping damage vs. use damage?
    - Is the stated reason consistent with the product type?

investigate_claim:
  scope: |
    - Return history: How many returns has this customer made in the last 12 months?
      What percentage of purchases are returned? Is the rate above 15%?
    - Value pattern: Are returns concentrated in high-value electronics (>$500)?
    - Timing: Is this return near the end of the return window (days 25-30)?
    - Serial returner flags: Has the customer returned the same product category
      multiple times? Multiple "defective" claims?
    - Wardrobing risk: For electronics, check if item shows signs of extended use
      (screen time, setup completion, software installed)
    - Account age: Is this a new account making high-value purchases and returns?
