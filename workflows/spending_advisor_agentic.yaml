# Agentic Spending Advisor — Workflow Layer
#
# The orchestrator LLM decides which primitives to invoke and in what
# order. This file defines ONLY the cognitive pattern and constraints.
# Domain expertise (primitive_configs, goal details, orchestrator
# strategy) comes from the domain YAML.
#
# Run:
#   python -m engine.runner \
#     -w workflows/spending_advisor_agentic.yaml \
#     -d domains/debit_spending_agentic.yaml \
#     -c cases/spending_advisor_williams.json
