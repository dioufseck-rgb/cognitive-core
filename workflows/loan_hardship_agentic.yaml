# Agentic Loan Hardship Assessment — Workflow Layer
#
# The orchestrator decides the sequence based on what it discovers.
# For military cases, it should investigate SCRA protections.
# For clear cases, it can move directly to generate guidance.
# For ambiguous cases, it can investigate deeper or escalate.
#
# Run:
#   python -m engine.runner \
#     -w workflows/loan_hardship_agentic.yaml \
#     -d domains/military_hardship_agentic.yaml \
#     -c cases/military_hardship_reeves.json
