    "description": "I deposited a check for $4,200 from my employer on Monday February 10th via mobile deposit. It is now Friday February 14th and the funds are STILL not available. This is completely unacceptable. I have bills due this weekend and my account shows the deposit as 'pending'. I've been a member for almost 8 years and I've never had a check take this long. My direct deposits always clear same day. I need these funds released IMMEDIATELY or I will be looking at moving my accounts elsewhere. I've already been charged an NSF fee because a payment bounced while waiting for this check. This is costing me money."
