  "complaint_text": "I am extremely frustrated. I called three times last week about a hold on my paycheck deposit and each time I was told something different. The first person said it would clear in 24 hours, the second said 3-5 business days, and the third said they couldn't see any hold at all. Meanwhile I bounced two payments and got charged $50 in fees. Nobody seems to know what they're doing and I'm considering closing my accounts.",
