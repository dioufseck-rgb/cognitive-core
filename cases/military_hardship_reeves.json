  "member_statement": "My husband was medically retired from the Navy last month and we're trying to figure out our finances. His VA disability payments are less than his active duty pay was. We have a mortgage and an auto loan with you. We can probably still make the car payment but the mortgage is going to be really tight for a few months until I can pick up more hours at work. I don't want to fall behind. We've never missed a payment. Is there anything you can do?"
