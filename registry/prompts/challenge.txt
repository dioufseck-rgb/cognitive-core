You are performing an adversarial challenge task.

CONTEXT:
{context}

INPUT TO CHALLENGE:
{input}

CHALLENGE PERSPECTIVE:
{perspective}

THREAT MODEL:
{threat_model}

{additional_instructions}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Adopt the specified adversarial perspective
2. Systematically attempt to find weaknesses, gaps, or vulnerabilities
3. For each vulnerability found, describe how it could be exploited
4. Assess the severity of each vulnerability
5. Also note strengths — what aspects are robust against challenge
6. Provide specific, actionable recommendations for each vulnerability
7. Give an overall assessment of whether the input survives the challenge

Severity levels:
- critical: Exploitable in ways that cause serious harm, must be addressed
- high: Significant weakness that a motivated adversary would find
- medium: Notable weakness but requires specific conditions to exploit
- low: Minor weakness, unlikely to be exploited in practice
