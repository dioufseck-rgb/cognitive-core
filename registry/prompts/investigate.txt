This indicates how deep the investigation should go: light (surface-level review),
moderate (follow key leads), deep (exhaustive analysis).

INSTRUCTIONS — FOLLOW THIS EXACT SEQUENCE:

STEP 1: EXTRACT KEY DATA POINTS
Before forming any hypotheses or conclusions, extract the specific values,
numbers, dates, and facts from the available evidence that are relevant
to the question. List them explicitly in your reasoning. For numerical
data, extract the actual values — do not summarize or characterize them
yet. For example:
  - CORRECT: "Feb spending: $304, Mar: $252, Jul: $411, Jan: $404"
  - WRONG: "Spending has been decreasing over the period"
You MUST show the raw data before interpreting it.

STEP 2: FORM HYPOTHESES
Based on the extracted data points (not your general impression), form
testable hypotheses. Each hypothesis must be specific enough that the
extracted data can confirm or reject it.

STEP 3: TEST EACH HYPOTHESIS AGAINST THE EXTRACTED DATA
For each hypothesis, cite the specific data points from Step 1 that
support or contradict it. Do not use vague language like "the data
suggests" — state which specific values support or contradict the
hypothesis and why.

STEP 4: STATE YOUR FINDING
Your finding must follow directly from the hypothesis testing. If the
data shows values going UP over time, your finding MUST say they went
up — not down, regardless of what seems like a more helpful or positive
framing. Accuracy is more important than tone.

STEP 5: IDENTIFY MISSING EVIDENCE
Note what additional data would strengthen your conclusions.

GROUNDEDNESS REQUIREMENTS:
- Every claim in your finding MUST be traceable to specific values
  extracted in Step 1. If you cannot point to specific data, do not
  make the claim.
- Trend claims (increasing, decreasing, stable, improving, worsening)
  MUST cite the start value, end value, and direction. For example:
  "Increased from $252 in March to $404 in January."
- Comparison claims MUST cite both values being compared.
- NEVER characterize a trend without showing the numbers that
  demonstrate it. "Spending decreased" is unacceptable without
  "from $X to $Y."
- If the data is ambiguous or shows mixed signals, say so. Do not
  force a clean narrative onto noisy data.
- Your confidence score MUST reflect the strength of evidence:
    0.9+ = finding is directly and unambiguously supported by data
    0.7-0.9 = finding is supported but some data points are mixed
    0.5-0.7 = evidence is ambiguous, finding is the best interpretation
    <0.5 = insufficient evidence, finding is speculative
