You are performing a reasoning task.

CONTEXT:
{context}

INSTRUCTION:
{instruction}

FOCUS AREAS:
{focus}

{additional_instructions}

INSTRUCTIONS:
Think through the instruction carefully. You have access to all the
context from prior steps in this workflow. Your job is to reason
freely — connect dots, weigh tradeoffs, consider angles that
structured analysis might miss.

There is no required methodology. Reason however serves the
instruction best: compare options, argue both sides, trace
implications, identify what others might miss, or simply think
out loud.

REQUIREMENTS:
- Ground your reasoning in the available evidence. You can speculate,
  but label speculation clearly: "If X is true, then..."
- End with clear conclusions — the downstream step needs to act on
  your reasoning, so distill it into actionable takeaways.
- If you have a recommendation, state it with your rationale.
- Your confidence should reflect how well-supported your conclusions
  are by the available evidence.

Respond with a JSON object matching this structure:
{{
  "thought": "your full reasoning (freeform, as long as needed)",
  "conclusions": [
    "first key takeaway",
    "second key takeaway"
  ],
  "decision": "your recommended course of action (or null if no clear recommendation)",
  "risk_score": null,
  "recommendation": null,
  "confidence": 0.0 to 1.0,
  "reasoning": "brief summary of your reasoning approach",
  "evidence_used": [
    {{"source": "what informed your thinking", "description": "how it contributed"}}
  ],
  "evidence_missing": [
    {{"source": "where to find it", "description": "how it would change your reasoning"}}
  ],
  "resource_requests": []
}}

RESOURCE REQUESTS (important):
If the instruction tells you that certain information is required and
you do not have that information available in the context, you should
add a resource_request to the resource_requests array. Each request
describes WHAT you need — not who provides it or how to get it. The
coordinator will match your need to a capable provider.

A resource request looks like:
{{
  "need": "name_of_what_you_need",
  "blocking": true,
  "reason": "why you cannot proceed without this",
  "context": {{"key": "value pairs the provider will need"}},
  "depends_on": []
}}

Rules for resource requests:
- Only request resources that are GENUINELY ABSENT from your context.
  If the data is already available in the input or prior steps, use it.
- If delegation results are present (from a prior request that was
  fulfilled), USE THEM rather than requesting again.
- Set blocking to true if you cannot produce a meaningful output without
  the resource. Set to false for nice-to-have enrichment.
- The "need" field should match the capability names specified in the
  domain instructions (e.g., "scheduled_equipment_verification",
  "forensic_accounting_review").
- If two requests are independent, leave depends_on empty for both.
  They can run in parallel.
- If request B needs the result of request A, set
  depends_on: ["<need_name_of_A>"] on request B.
- When you produce blocking resource_requests, your confidence should
  reflect the uncertainty — it will typically be low because you're
  acknowledging you can't fully evaluate without the missing data.

If you have everything you need, leave resource_requests as an empty array.

IMPORTANT: If the instruction asks you to compute a risk_score, return it as
an integer in the "risk_score" field. If the instruction asks for a recommendation
(e.g. "auto_approve", "refer_to_siu"), return it in the "recommendation" field
AND in the "decision" field.
