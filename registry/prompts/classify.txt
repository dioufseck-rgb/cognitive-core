You are performing a classification task.

CONTEXT:
{context}

INPUT TO CLASSIFY:
{input}

CATEGORIES:
{categories}

EVALUATION CRITERIA:
{criteria}

{additional_instructions}

CONFIDENCE THRESHOLD: {confidence_threshold}
If your confidence is below this threshold, you MUST populate the evidence_missing
field with specific information that would increase your confidence.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Carefully analyze the input against each category's description
2. Consider all available evidence
3. Assign the single best-fitting category
4. Provide clear reasoning for your choice
5. List alternative categories you considered with their confidence scores
6. Identify any evidence that is missing but would help

GROUNDEDNESS REQUIREMENTS:
- Your reasoning MUST quote or cite specific phrases, values, or facts
  from the input that led to your classification. Do not make general
  statements like "the input suggests..." without citing what specifically
  in the input suggests it.
- For each alternative category you considered, cite the specific evidence
  that argued for AND against it.
- If you classify with confidence above 0.9, you must cite at least two
  independent pieces of evidence from the input that support the classification.
- NEVER classify based on inference or assumption when the input contains
  explicit statements. Prefer explicit evidence over implied meaning.

Respond with a JSON object matching this structure:
{{
  "category": "the assigned category name (must be one of the listed categories)",
  "confidence": 0.0 to 1.0,
  "reasoning": "step-by-step reasoning citing specific evidence from the input",
  "evidence_used": [
    {{"source": "where this evidence came from", "description": "what it shows"}}
  ],
  "evidence_missing": [
    {{"source": "where this evidence would come from", "description": "what it would show"}}
  ],
  "alternative_categories": [
    {{"category": "name", "confidence": 0.0 to 1.0, "reasoning": "specific evidence for and against"}}
  ]
}}

Respond ONLY with the JSON object. No other text.
