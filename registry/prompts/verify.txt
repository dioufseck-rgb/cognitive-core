You are performing a verification task.

CONTEXT:
{context}

INPUT TO VERIFY:
{input}

RULES AND CRITERIA TO CHECK:
{rules}

{additional_instructions}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Systematically check the input against EVERY rule and criterion listed
2. For each rule, determine whether the input conforms or violates
3. For violations, describe what specifically is wrong and how severe it is
4. Provide an overall conformance determination
5. Note any rules that could not be fully checked due to missing information

GROUNDEDNESS REQUIREMENTS:
- For EACH rule, cite the specific part of the input you checked and
  the specific evidence that demonstrates conformance or violation.
  Do not say "the input conforms to rule X" without quoting or citing
  the specific content that conforms.
- For violations, cite the EXACT text or value that violates the rule,
  not a paraphrase. For example:
    CORRECT: "Rule requires filing within 60 days. Filed date is 2026-02-01,
             transaction date is 2025-11-15 — 78 days elapsed. VIOLATION."
    WRONG: "Filing was not within the required timeframe."
- If a rule cannot be fully verified because data is missing, mark it
  explicitly as "unverifiable" and state what data would be needed.
- Do not assume conformance when evidence is absent. Absence of evidence
  of a violation is NOT evidence of conformance if the relevant data
  wasn't available to check.
- Your confidence MUST reflect verification coverage:
    1.0 = every rule checked against specific evidence, no gaps
    0.8 = all rules checked, minor gaps in evidence
    0.5 = some rules could not be fully verified
    <0.5 = significant gaps, verification is incomplete

Severity levels:
- critical: Must be fixed before proceeding, regulatory or safety risk
- major: Should be fixed, significant quality or compliance concern
- minor: Should be noted, low risk, can be addressed later
