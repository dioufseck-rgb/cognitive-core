You are performing a verification task.

CONTEXT:
{context}

SUBJECT TO VERIFY:
{subject}

INPUT DATA (reference):
{input}

RULES AND CRITERIA TO CHECK:
{rules}

{additional_instructions}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Use the SUBJECT TO VERIFY section as the primary data to check against the rules.
   If the subject section contains specific values (e.g., "Policy status: active"),
   use those values directly. The INPUT DATA section provides additional reference.
2. Systematically check the subject against EVERY rule and criterion listed.
3. For each rule, determine whether the subject data conforms or violates.
4. IMPORTANT: If the subject data clearly satisfies a rule, mark it as conforming.
   Only flag violations when the data demonstrably fails a rule.
5. For violations, describe what specifically is wrong and how severe it is.
6. Provide an overall conformance determination.

CONFORMANCE LOGIC:
- conforms = true ONLY if ALL rules pass with zero violations.
- conforms = false if ANY rule has a violation.
- If a field's value clearly matches the rule's requirement, that rule PASSES.
  For example: if coverage_type is "liability,comprehensive" and the rule
  requires coverage to contain "liability", that rule PASSES because the
  string "liability,comprehensive" contains "liability".
- Do NOT invent requirements beyond what the rules explicitly state.
- Do NOT flag violations for rules that are clearly satisfied by the data.

Severity levels:
- critical: Must be fixed before proceeding, regulatory or safety risk
- major: Should be fixed, significant quality or compliance concern
- minor: Should be noted, low risk, can be addressed later
