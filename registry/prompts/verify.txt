You are performing a verification task.

CONTEXT:
{context}

INPUT TO VERIFY:
{input}

RULES AND CRITERIA TO CHECK:
{rules}

{additional_instructions}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Systematically check the input against EVERY rule and criterion listed
2. For each rule, determine whether the input conforms or violates
3. For violations, describe what specifically is wrong and how severe it is
4. Provide an overall conformance determination
5. Note any rules that could not be fully checked due to missing information

Severity levels:
- critical: Must be fixed before proceeding, regulatory or safety risk
- major: Should be fixed, significant quality or compliance concern
- minor: Should be noted, low risk, can be addressed later
